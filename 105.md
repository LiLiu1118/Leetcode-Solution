#  105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* buildTree(vector<int>& preorder, vector<int>& inorder) {
        unordered_map<int, int> M;
        for (int i=0; i < inorder.size(); i++){
            M[inorder[i]] = i;
        }
        return splitTree(preorder, M, 0, 0, inorder.size()-1);
    }
private:
    TreeNode* splitTree(vector<int>& P, unordered_map<int, int>& M, int pix, int ileft, int iright) {
        int rval = P[pix], imid = M[rval];
        TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(rval);
        if (imid > ileft){
            root->left = splitTree(P, M, pix+1, ileft, imid-1) ;
        }
        if (imid < iright){
            root->right = splitTree(P, M, pix+imid-ileft+1, imid+1, iright) ;
        }
        
        return root;
    }
};
```

# 思路

A preorder traversal is [node, left, right] while an inorder traversal is [left, node, right].We know that the root node for a tree is the first element of the preorder array (P). We also know that every element to the left of the root element in the inorder array (I) is on the left subtree, and everything to the right of the root element in I is on the right subtree.Since we know the length of the left and right subtrees by finding the root in I, and since we know the order of the left and right subtrees in P, we can use that to determine the location of the root node in P for each of the two subtrees.With this information, we can define a recursive helper function (splitTree) that will split the tree into two and then recursively do the same for each subtree.


![105算法图解](https://github.com/LiLiu1118/Leetcode-Solution/blob/main/Markdown%20Photos/105.gif)

We could iterate forward through I until we found out the location (imid) of the root node each time, but that would push this solution to a time complexity of O(N^2).

Instead, we can make a prelimanary index map (M) of the values in I, so that we can look up the value for imid in O(1) time in each recursion. This will lower the time complexity to O(N) at the cost of a space complexity of O(N).
