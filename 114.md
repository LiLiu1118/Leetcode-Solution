#  114. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List

##  recursive reverse-preorder(right,left,node)
```c++
class Solution {//recursive reverse-preorder(right,left,node)
public:    
    void flatten(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root) revPreorder(root);
    }
private:
    TreeNode* head = NULL;
    void revPreorder(TreeNode* node){
        if (node->right) revPreorder(node->right);
        if (node->left) revPreorder(node->left);
        node->left = NULL; node->right = head; head = node;
    }
};

```

# 思路

题目虽然是要求preorder，但是实际操作要用reverse-preorder(right,left,node),因为最右边的节点在所需链表的最后面，需要从链表的最末尾开始处理，所以实际上顺序为right,left,node.然后每次更新head的步骤也很重要.

Time Complexity: O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

Space Complexity: O(N) for the recursion stack, which is as long as the maximum depth of the binary. tree, which can go up to N

Recursion stack: To conclude, space complexity of recursive algorithm is proportinal to maximum depth of recursion tree generated. If each function call of recursive algorithm takes O(m) space and if the maximum depth of recursion tree is 'n' then space complexity of recursive algorithm would be O(nm).

##  Morris Traversal
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    void flatten(TreeNode* root) {
        TreeNode* curr = root;
        while (curr){//到链表尾部了，终止条件
            if (curr->left){
                TreeNode* runner = curr->left;
                while (runner->right){
                    runner = runner->right;
                }
                runner->right = curr->right;
                curr->right = curr->left;
                curr->left = NULL;                
            }
            curr = curr->right;
        }
    }
};
```

# 思路

The approach is called the Morris traversal. At its heart, it takes advantage of the basic nature of ordered traversals to iterate through and unwind the tree. In a pre-order traversal of a binary tree, each vertex is processed in (node, left, right) order. This means that the entire left subtree could be placed between the node and its right subtree.

To do this, however, we'll first have to locate the last node in the left subtree. This is easy enough, since we know that the last node of a pre-order tree can be found by moving right as many times as possible from its root.
